This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts house prices based on various features such as location, number of bedrooms, square footage, and more. The model is trained on a dataset of historical house sales and uses a combination of regression algorithms to make accurate predictions.

𝙁𝙚𝙖𝙩𝙪𝙧𝙚𝙨:


Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables
Model Training: Implementing and comparing different regression algorithms (e.g. Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest)
Model Evaluation: Measuring performance metrics (e.g. Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, R-Squared)
Deployment: Creating a user-friendly interface for users to input features and receive predicted house prices
